Airbnb Clone
Summary
This marks a phase in replicating Airbnb's functionality, focusing on HTML and CSS development. The "Images" folder houses necessary icons like logos, bathroom symbols, bedroom symbols, and guest icons. CSS files in the "Styles" directory define styling, with those numbered highest in each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places) being most relevant. Similarly, the index.html file with the highest numerical prefix is crucial for the final version.
